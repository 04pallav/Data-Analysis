## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Purpose

This markdown document is designed to run a clean building energy dataset 
through all ten cycle two markers. There markers have been designed by the EdIFES
team but have not been assembled into a single document. The markers have been numbered
in alphabetical order for reference. The ten markers and authors
are as follows:

| Function                   | Author  | File Name                         |
|----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Base:Peak Ratio            | Arash   | base_peak_ratio_one.R             |
| Baseload                   | Arash   | baseload_two.R                    |
| Energy Use Intensity       | Shreyas | calc_eui_three.R                  |
| Daylight Mismatch          | Arash   | daylight_mismatch_four.R          |
| Seasonal Variability       | Arash   | h_var_season.R                    |
| Change Behaviors           | Rojiar  | prd_change_behaviors.R            |
| Chi Square Periodogram     | Rojiar  | prd_chisquare_periodogram_seven.R |
| Renewable Energy           | Rojiar  | prd_renewable_energy_eight.R      |
| Summary Statistics         | Shreyas | produce_summary_statistics_nine.R |
| Rescheduling Opportunities | Rojiar  | reschedule_opportunities_ten.R    |


This markdown file should be run in the same directory as all of the 
building marker R files. The data directory should be one level up from this directory
and should contain the cleaned buildings as csv files. This markdown file is designed to work with any cleaned buildings. 

# Marker One: Base to Peak Ratio

This marker calculates the ratio of the base load to the ratio of the peak electricity consumption.

```{r}
dir('./data')
```
